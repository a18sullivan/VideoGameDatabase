To run this program put game_database.sqlite3 and GuiWindow.py into an IDE project folder  
then install all necessary libraries that are imported in GuiWindow.py then simply press run in the IDE.
The code will take care of the rest to exit the program just x out of the Gui window

I have implemented the add and search functionality along with a fully functioning GUI
both of these functionality work fine but do not have extensive error handling, so they will not prevent things
such as sql attacks or improper data entry

The update functionality has not been implemented yet
